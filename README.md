# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Goal 
The goal of this project was to amiliarize ourselves with Refractoring: updating existing code in order to run smoothly and have an easy-to-read presentation.

## Focuses 
I focused primarily on converting the non-semantic text into semantic text. Also, accesibility was improved for people using assistive technologies.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria Fulfilled

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up
